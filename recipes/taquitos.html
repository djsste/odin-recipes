    <p><strong>Description:</strong>Easy Breakfast Taquitos have scrambled eggs, cheese and sausage links rolled and baked inside a corn tortilla. They are quick to make, and fun to eat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>▢1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>8 thick slices bread</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F or or heat a skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add all ingredients, except the bread, to a blender or to a shallow dish and whisk well to combine. If whisking by hand, mix flour and eggs together first, then add remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Dip bread slices into the batter, dredging them well on both sides, and place on hot, greased griddle or skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook for a few minutes, until the bottom of the breads starts to get golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side the same.</li>
