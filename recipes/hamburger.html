    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A classic, juicy Hamburger Recipe made with ground chuck, a simple burger seasoning, and all of the classic burger toppings. Plus, tips for preparing the meat and cooking the burgers to they are tender and juicy!</p>

    <h3>Burger Seasonings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep seasoning.  Combine all spices in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>2. Form patties. Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently form into ½ inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns (as they will shrink).  Use your thumb to press an indentation into the center of each patty. Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>3. Grill. Just before cooking, sprinkle seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill, indent-side up. Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F. If adding cheese, place cheese slices on burgers during the last minute of cooking.</li>
        <li>4. Serve. Remove patties to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving in a bun, with toppings.</li>
    </ol>
